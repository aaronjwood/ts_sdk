This directory houses example firmware that make use of the Verizon IoT
protocols (Over The Top (OTT) and SMSNAS) to communicate with the cloud.
Protocol functionalities are exposed to the users through Cloud Communication
(CC module) APIs.

Functional overview of the firmware:
------------------------------------
This example exposes BME280 sensor and gps chipset interface to the main 
firmware in a uniform way. This example share the code that enables 
communication with the cloud. The basic flow of the firmware is as
follows:

1) Based on protocol selected it communicates with the cloud services.

2) Read BME280 sensor for pressure, tempratue and humidity values, get GPS 
   location and transmit all this information in single message.

3) Wait until the next reporting interval which is set by application, or in
   case of OTT protocol wait till minimum(reporting, polling) interval as OTT
   OTT protocol requires application to poll cloud services to retrieve any
   pending update messages.

4) Wake up all sensors and repeat from step 2.

To convey the usage of the Cloud Communication API in the most simple way
possible,  no measures have been taken to handle connection timeouts or to
perform retries on failed transactions. All calls to the API are wrapped with
an ASSERT macro.  On the first unexpected return value, execution stops.
