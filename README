This repository contains a reference implementation of firmware for use
with the Dakota "Over The Top" (OTT) IoT services.  The firmware is intended for
use on a microcontroller (MCU) connected to an LTE modem.

The current target hardware is a NUCLEO-F429ZI ARM development board connected to
a Sierrra Wireless HL7588 modem.

Repository contents:

	tools/scripts - Toolchain build scripts
	tools/installed - Directory to hold toolchain, device support files,
			  SDK libraries, etc. that are installed from an
			  external source.

	apps/ 	      -  Sample applications built to communicate with the
			 OTT services.

	lib/          -  Library components used by the apps to communicate
