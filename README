1. Overview
------------
This repository contains the reference implementation of the Thingspace SDK (TS
SDK) along with examples that use it. The TS SDK provides a set of API routines
that enable an IoT device (defined here as a microcontroller (MCU) connected to
an LTE modem) to communicate with the Thingspace IoT services.

The following diagram summarizes how the TS SDK fits into the structure of a
regular user application:

                          +--------------------+
                          |  User Application  |
                          |    & conf file     |
                          |         +----------+
                          |         | TS SDK & |
                          |         | conf file|
                          +---------+----------+
                          |        HAL         |
                          +--------------------+
                          |   Microcontroller  |
                          +--------------------+

Note that while the user application and the SDK are shown to rely on the same
HAL in the above diagram, that need not necessarily be true. The application is
free to implement its own drivers.


2. SDK capabilities
--------------------
The SDK API was designed to be agnostic of the target platform, the data
transport and the protocol to be used over the transport. These are configurable
during the build step. The modem and the MCU communicate with each other through
a serial connection between them. So far the only modem supported is the UBLOX
TOBY-L201.


2.1 Supported targets
----------------------
The following targets are supported by the SDK:
        o MCU: STM32F429ZI
          Family: ARM Cortex M4
          Boards: NUCLEO-F429ZI ARM development board


2.2 Supported proprietary protocols
---------------------------------------
        o Over-the-top (OTT) - uses TCP/IP as low level transport
        o SMSNAS - uses SMS as low level transport


3. Repository layout

                                        Docker container to place all the
                                        application related object files and
                                        binary images which can be later used to
                                        upload firmware to target platform.

                                        build process or do work in the source
                                        repository.

ts_sdk/tools/scripts                    Scripts to assist with building,
                                        configuring tools, scanning source code,
                                        etc.

                                        SDK is executing. The build might
                                        process these into a different form
                                        depending on the target e.g. a firmware
                                        image with no filesystem.

                                        Each component has a source code
                                        directory tree under here. Ideally we
                                        use the same components across all
                                        chipsets and OSs. Some likely components
                                        are shown below.

                                        across multiple chipsets, OSs,
                                        protocols, etc.

                                        abstractions e.g. UART access, hardware
                                        RNG, timers, etc.

ts_sdk/platform/sw                      Files implementing common software
                                        abstractions.

                                        these abstractions.

ts_sdk/targets                          Optional directory containing chipset
                                        sdk and other required tools


4. Thingspace account and device management
--------------------------------------------
The repository contains a script (thingspace-client-api.sh) to help the user
create and manage their account and create and control devices registered to
Thingspace. The script is located under ts_sdk/tools/scripts.

Usually the first step is to create an account followed by registering a device.
Account creation is a one time step. Depending on the protocol being used, a set
of device credentials may be retrieved from the cloud when creating the device.
Refer to Section 5.1.1 to see how device credentials are used to configure the
firmware.

The script can also be used to delete accounts, remove devices, send update
messages to the device, query status messages the device sends back to
Thingspace services etc. For a detailed description on using the script refer to
the script's help:
thingspace-client-api.sh help


5. Building the SDK
--------------------
By default, the TS SDK and accompanying examples are built using the ARM
embedded GCC toolchain. Details of this toolchain are as follows:
        o Version: gcc-arm-none-eabi-5_4-2016q2
        o Link to binaries: https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+download

To make the build process easier, a Docker container with the toolchain is
provided via Dockerhub. The actual build command is issued via scripts. For
information on how to invoke the scripts, please refer to Section 5.2.


5.1 Protocol specific configurations
-------------------------------------
Before building the firmware, certain aspects of the protocol being used will
need to be configured. The following sections briefly describe the configuration
steps for all supported protocol/transport combinations.


5.1.1 OTT protocol
-------------------
The OTT protocol has two configuration components.

Configuring mbedTLS
--------------------
There is a script added to vendor/mbedtls: vz_configure_mbedtls
It is intended to capture the changes needed to customize mbed TLS to the
minimum set of features that will allow the sample applications to communicate
with the Verizon cloud services.

The script will edit:
        vendor/mbedtls/include/mbedtls/config.h.original

to produce the desired configuration in:
        vendor/mbedtls/include/mbedtls/config.h

That version of config.h is checked into the repository.

The script currently has options to enable/disable certain library features,
which allows the library to be customized for test/experimental purposes:

$ ./vz_configure_mbedtls help
Usage:
    vz_configure_mbedtls [help] [debug] [no-net] [full-msgs] [no-hwrng]

debug     - will enable debug messages in the library, especially for TLS
            errors. Makes the code much bigger but otherwise it's hard to
            tell why something fails.

no-net    - disables the mbed TLS OS networking module. Set this when building
            for the "network over modem" library.


full-msgs - support full-sized TLS messages as defined in the RFC.
            (by default we know that the largest OTT message is much smaller).

no-hwrng  - Disable using the device hardware random number generator.
            Set this to use the Linux/OSX /dev/random sources instead.

heap-prof - Use a custom allocator to record maximum heap used.

To build the mbedtls_test program to run on OSX (i.e. by setting
CHIPSET_FAMILY = osx in mbedtls_test/Makefile), you need to configure the library
as:

        ./vz_configure_mbedtls full-msgs no-hwrng


Configuring device credentials
-------------------------------
After creating an account using thingspace-client-api.sh script (see Section 4),
create an OTT device. This will retrieve a device ID and device secret. These
two are collectively termed device credentials and are used to authenticate the
device when it tries to communicate with Thingspace. Before building the SDK and
accompanying examples, the user must use the 'C compatible' forms of the device
credentials to populate the corresponding entries in:
ts_sdk/sdk/cloud_comm/inc/dev_creds/dev_creds.h


5.1.2 SMSNAS protocol
----------------------
No additional configuration is needed to build the TS SDK for the SMSNAS protocol.


5.2 Building and Uploading the SDK with the user application
-----------------------------------------------
The SDK can be built with the application source. The actual build takes place inside a
Docker container started by the build script (build.sh) located at:
ts_sdk/tools/scripts/. It must be invoked from the repository root.

Build:
Execute tools/scripts/build.sh help for further information.

Upload:
Execute tools/scripts/upload_firmware.sh help for firmware uploading/burning information.

Refer to Section 6 for the steps to create new application that can be built with
this approach.


5.3 Building the SDK into a static library
-------------------------------------------
The purpose of this build target is to allow the application to use the
TS SDK without imposing restrictions on the user's source tree and build process.
This process builds libsdk.a and installs all the necessary headers to provided
destination.

Steps to build:
1) run source tools/scripts/config_build_env.sh [options]
        This step configures SDK and exports necessary variables used by SDK
        build process.
        Note: User still need to modify CC, AR and RANLIB variable in
        sdk/<sdk_name>/Makefile to point to correct toolchain
2) tools/scripts/build.sh install_sdk <absolute path to install>
        For OTT_PROTOCOL, it also installs mbedtls related static libraries
        Note: This also installs platform dependent headers at <path>/platform_inc
        for end user to provide similar APIs and variables that sdk library depends
        on.

6. Creating a new user application
-----------------------------------
All user applications that are built along with the SDK should reside in
ts_sdk/apps. They are expected to roughly have the following directory layout:

apps/
|
+- <app_name>/
  |
  +- Makefile
  +- header and source directories/files

Makefile should provide APP_SRC for source files, vpath to search for the APP_SRC
and APP_INC for application headers. Applicaton should also include *.mk from
sdk/<sdk_name>/*.mk and platform/*.mk (depends if platform is supported by SDK).
Some make helpers are provided at tools/config/*.mk, look for common.mk for the example.
Example code in apps/<app_dir> provides example Makefile and application implementation.

Before building application, user needs to run "source tools/script/config_build_env.sh <options>"
to set up necessary build and sdk options. Script exports below variables based on
user input which are being consumed by various *.mk files. help in <options> for
above script provides detail usage.

        o DEV_BOARD      : development board
        o CHIPSET_FAMILY : micro controller family
        o CHIPSET_MCU    : micro controller or application processor
        o PROTOCOL       : OTT_PROTOCOL, SMSNAS_PROTOCOL, NO_PROTOCOL
        o MODEM_TARGET   : modem

Use the following command to build the user application (assuming current
location is repository root):
./tools/scripts/build.sh help

7. Generating documentation
----------------------------
TS SDK relies on Doxygen to generate documentation from its source files. There
are two sets of documentations that can be generated: for the SDK itself and for
the hardware abstraction layer (HAL) used to keep it platform agnostic.

A Makefile located in ts_sdk/Documents/doxygen/ simplifies the generation
process. Following are the commands supported by it:

Command                 Description
--------------          -----------------------------------------------
make all                Generate documentation for both the SDK and HAL
make sdk-docs           Generate documentation for the SDK
make hal-docs           Generate documentation for the HAL
make clean              Remove all generated documentation

All documentation is generated in ts_sdk/Documents/doxygen/build
