1) Dockerfile.thingservice -      Pulls ubunutu 16.04 base image with gcc arm
                                  toolchain at /ts_sdk_bldenv/toolchain from the
                                  verizon internal server and copies additional

2) Dockerfile.dockerhub -         Same as above except that it pulls base images
